## Using
> [!WARNING]
> Use at your own risk.
- Download [latest release](https://github.com/Volucer/wotr-fixes/releases)
- Unpack files from bundle.zip to bundle folder (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\War of the Roses\bundle\\)
- In game folder: Shift + Right-click on wotr.exe - select Copy as path
- Go to Steam - Library - right click War of the Roses - Properties - LAUNCH OPTIONS
- Paste your copied path and add %command% at the end after space
- "your path to wotr.exe" %command%

Examples of how it should look like:
```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\War of the Roses\wotr.exe" %command%
"D:\Games\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\War of the Roses\wotr.exe" %command%
```
- Launch game
## Additional launch options
Lobby name and player limit:
- -lobbyname "server name": custom names for servers.
- -lobbymaxmembers 256: server player limit, default value without command is 256.
- -timelimit 123456: round time in seconds.
- -winscore 123: round win score (up to 1000).

And lobby visibility:
- -lobbyprivate: private server (probably useless, invites don't seem to work).
- -lobbyfriends: friends only server (only friends can see or join? Not tested).

You can add these commands to game launch options after %command%.

Should look something like this:
```
"your path to wotr.exe" %command% -lobbyname "my super-duper server" -lobbymaxmembers 8
```
Or you can create a .bat file in game folder with:
```
wotr.exe -bundle-dir bundle -lobbyname "my super-duper server" -lobbymaxmembers 8
```
And launch game through .bat file.
## Dedicated server
